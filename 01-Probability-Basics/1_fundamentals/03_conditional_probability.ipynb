    "2. **Bayes' Theorem**: A disease affects 3% of plants. A test is 95% sensitive and has 10% false positive rate. If a plant tests positive, what's the probability it's actually diseased?\n",

    "3. **Independence**: P(rain) = 0.3, P(cold) = 0.4, P(rain AND cold) = 0.15. Are these independent?\n",

    "4. **Law of Total Probability**: Three varieties: A (30%), B (50%), C (20%). Success rates: A (70%), B (80%), C (60%). What's overall success probability?\n",
