    "## Summary: Key Lessons\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Base Rates Matter\n",
    "- Low disease prevalence means most positive tests are false positives\n",
    "- Always consider prior probability, not just test accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Economic Decision Making\n",
    "- Compare expected costs of treating vs. not treating\n",
    "- Decision depends on:\n",
    "  - Test results (posterior probability)\n",
    "  - Treatment cost\n",
    "  - Potential crop loss\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Multiple Evidence\n",
    "- Combining multiple symptoms/tests dramatically improves diagnosis\n",
    "- Each piece of evidence updates our probability\n",
    "- Bayesian updating is the mathematically correct way to combine information\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Practical Applications\n",
    "- Disease diagnosis and treatment decisions\n",
    "- Quality control and testing\n",
    "- Risk assessment\n",
    "- Resource allocation\n",
