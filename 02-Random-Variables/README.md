# Random Variables

Understanding random variables and probability distributions for agricultural data modeling.

## Overview

Random variables provide a mathematical way to work with uncertain outcomes. Learn to model agricultural phenomena like crop yields, rainfall amounts, and pest counts as random variables.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand discrete and continuous random variables
- Work with probability mass functions (PMF) and probability density functions (PDF)
- Calculate expected values and variances
- Apply random variables to agricultural modeling

## Status

**📋 Planned** - Content coming soon!

This module will cover:
- Discrete random variables (crop disease presence/absence)
- Continuous random variables (rainfall amounts, temperatures)
- Expected value and variance calculations
- Agricultural applications

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Topic 01: Probability Basics
- Understanding of probability concepts

## Coming Soon

Module structure will follow the same 4-part approach:
1. **Fundamentals**: Theory with visual examples
2. **From Scratch**: NumPy implementations
3. **With SciPy**: Using scipy.stats
4. **Agricultural Application**: Real-world problems
