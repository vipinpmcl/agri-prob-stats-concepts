# Common Probability Distributions

Master the probability distributions most commonly used in agricultural ML and statistics.

## Overview

Learn the distributions that model real agricultural phenomena: Normal for continuous measurements, Binomial for success/failure outcomes, Poisson for rare events, and more.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and use the Normal (Gaussian) distribution
- Apply Binomial distribution to binary outcomes
- Use Poisson distribution for count data
- Recognize which distribution fits agricultural data
- Understand the Central Limit Theorem

## Status

**📋 Planned** - Content coming soon!

This module will cover:
- Normal distribution (crop yields, soil measurements)
- Binomial distribution (germination success, disease occurrence)
- Poisson distribution (pest counts, rare events)
- Exponential and Uniform distributions
- Distribution selection for agricultural data

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Topic 02: Random Variables
- Understanding of expected value and variance

## Coming Soon

Module structure will follow the same 4-part approach:
1. **Fundamentals**: Theory with visual examples
2. **From Scratch**: NumPy implementations
3. **With SciPy**: Using scipy.stats distributions
4. **Agricultural Application**: Real-world problems

**Check back soon** as this module is developed!
