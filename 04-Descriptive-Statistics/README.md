# Descriptive Statistics

Learn to summarize and visualize agricultural data effectively.

## Overview

Descriptive statistics provide tools to understand data at a glance. Learn to calculate and interpret measures of central tendency, spread, and shape for agricultural datasets.

## Learning Objectives

- Calculate mean, median, and mode for agricultural data
- Understand variance, standard deviation, and range
- Create effective data visualizations
- Identify outliers and unusual patterns
- Summarize distributions effectively

## Status

**📋 Planned** - Content coming soon!

This module will cover:
- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measures of spread (variance, SD, IQR, range)
- Data visualization (histograms, box plots, scatter plots)
- Outlier detection methods
- Skewness and kurtosis
- Summary statistics for agricultural data

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Topic 03: Common Distributions
- Basic understanding of data structures

## Coming Soon

Module structure will follow the same 4-part approach:
1. **Fundamentals**: Theory with visual examples
2. **From Scratch**: NumPy/Pandas implementations
3. **With SciPy**: Using statistical libraries
4. **Agricultural Application**: Soil and crop data analysis

**Check back soon** as this module is developed!
