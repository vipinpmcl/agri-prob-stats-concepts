# Statistical Inference

Learn to make inferences about populations from sample data.

## Overview

Statistical inference allows us to draw conclusions about entire populations (all farms, all crops) from limited samples. Essential for agricultural research and decision-making.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand sampling distributions
- Perform point estimation (MLE, Method of Moments)
- Construct and interpret confidence intervals
- Apply the Central Limit Theorem
- Make inferences about agricultural populations

## Status

**📋 Planned** - Content coming soon!

This module will cover:
- Sampling distributions and sampling variability
- Point estimation methods (MLE, MoM)
- Confidence intervals for means and proportions
- Sample size determination
- Bootstrapping methods
- Agricultural applications: yield estimation, quality assessment

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Topic 04: Descriptive Statistics
- Understanding of common distributions

## Coming Soon

Module structure will follow the same 4-part approach:
1. **Fundamentals**: Theory with visual examples
2. **From Scratch**: NumPy implementations
3. **With SciPy/statsmodels**: Using statistical libraries
4. **Agricultural Application**: Estimating crop yields and quality metrics

**Check back soon** as this module is developed!
