# Hypothesis Testing

Learn to test claims and compare groups using statistical methods.

## Overview

Hypothesis testing provides a framework for making decisions based on data. Essential for agricultural research: Does this fertilizer work better? Are yields different across regions?

## Learning Objectives

- Formulate null and alternative hypotheses
- Understand p-values and significance levels
- Perform t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA
- Interpret test results correctly
- Avoid common statistical mistakes
- Compare agricultural treatments

## Status

**📋 Planned** - Content coming soon!

This module will cover:
- Hypothesis testing framework (H0, H1, p-values)
- Type I and Type II errors
- One-sample and two-sample t-tests
- Chi-square tests for categorical data
- ANOVA for multiple group comparisons
- Non-parametric tests
- Agricultural applications: comparing treatments, varieties, methods

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Topic 05: Statistical Inference
- Understanding of confidence intervals

## Coming Soon

Module structure will follow the same 4-part approach:
1. **Fundamentals**: Theory with visual examples
2. **From Scratch**: NumPy implementations
3. **With SciPy/statsmodels**: Using statistical testing libraries
4. **Agricultural Application**: Comparing fertilizers, varieties, irrigation methods
