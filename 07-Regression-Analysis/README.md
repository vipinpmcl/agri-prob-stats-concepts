# Regression Analysis

Learn to model relationships between variables and make predictions.

## Overview

Regression analysis is the foundation of predictive modeling. Learn to predict crop yields from soil properties, estimate outcomes from multiple factors, and understand model assumptions.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand linear regression fundamentals
- Build and interpret regression models
- Perform multiple regression with several predictors
- Check model assumptions and diagnostics
- Apply regularization (Ridge, Lasso)
- Predict agricultural outcomes

## Status

**📋 Planned** - Content coming soon!

This module will cover:
- Simple linear regression (one predictor)
- Multiple linear regression (many predictors)
- Model assumptions (linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality)
- Model diagnostics and validation
- Regularization methods (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net)
- Feature importance and interpretation
- Agricultural applications: yield prediction, quality modeling

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Topic 06: Hypothesis Testing
- Understanding of correlation and covariance

## Coming Soon

Module structure will follow the same 4-part approach:
1. **Fundamentals**: Theory with visual examples
2. **From Scratch**: NumPy implementations
3. **With Scikit-learn/statsmodels**: Using ML libraries
4. **Agricultural Application**: Predicting yields from soil and weather data

**Check back soon** as this module is developed!
