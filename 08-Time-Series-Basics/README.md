# Time Series Basics

Analyze sequential data and understand temporal patterns in agriculture.

## Overview

Time series analysis is critical for agriculture: weather patterns, seasonal trends, crop growth over time. Learn to decompose, analyze, and forecast time-dependent agricultural data.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand time series components (trend, seasonality, noise)
- Calculate and interpret autocorrelation
- Decompose time series data
- Test for stationarity
- Perform basic forecasting
- Apply to agricultural temporal data

## Status

**📋 Planned** - Content coming soon!

This module will cover:
- Time series components (trend, seasonality, residuals)
- Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation
- Stationarity and differencing
- Moving averages and smoothing
- Basic forecasting methods
- ARIMA models (introduction)
- Agricultural applications: weather forecasting, seasonal yield patterns

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Topic 07: Regression Analysis
- Understanding of correlation concepts

## Coming Soon

Module structure will follow the same 4-part approach:
1. **Fundamentals**: Theory with visual examples
2. **From Scratch**: NumPy/Pandas implementations
3. **With statsmodels**: Using time series libraries
4. **Agricultural Application**: Weather patterns, crop growth cycles
