# Bayesian Statistics

Learn Bayesian methods for updating beliefs with evidence and quantifying uncertainty.

## Overview

Bayesian statistics provides a framework for incorporating prior knowledge and updating beliefs as new data arrives. Essential for agricultural decision-making under uncertainty.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the Bayesian paradigm
- Work with prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions
- Perform Bayesian updating
- Calculate credible intervals
- Compare Bayesian and frequentist approaches
- Apply Bayesian methods to agricultural problems

## Status

**📋 Planned** - Content coming soon!

This module will cover:
- Bayesian vs frequentist philosophies
- Prior distributions (informative, non-informative)
- Likelihood functions
- Posterior distributions and updating
- Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation
- Credible intervals
- Bayesian decision theory
- Agricultural applications: risk assessment, adaptive management

## Prerequisites

- Completion of all previous topics (01-08)
- Strong understanding of probability and distributions

## Coming Soon

Module structure will follow the same 4-part approach:
1. **Fundamentals**: Theory with visual examples
2. **From Scratch**: NumPy implementations
3. **With PyMC/SciPy**: Using Bayesian libraries
4. **Agricultural Application**: Crop disease risk updating, adaptive irrigation

**Check back soon** as this module is developed!
